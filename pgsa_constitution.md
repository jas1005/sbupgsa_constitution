Following the warning, said individual may be placed on a probationary period determined by the Executive Committee for no less than 1 month and no longer than 6 months.
The individual must be notified regarding their probationary status and be clearly informed as to the length of the period.
Should the disruptive behavior continue without regard for the warning, the Executive Committee may seek mediation, so long as the probationary period has not expired.
A member may be placed on probation a maximum of two times before proceeding to the mediation step.
Providing a warning to a member or placing a member on probation requires the support of a simple majority of the Executive Committee.

Probation can entail, but is not limited to: a simple, formal warning and review period, barring the member from participating in activities of the Organization for a designated period of time, or revocation of the member&rsquo;s right to use shared spaces.

#### SUBSECTION B: MEDIATION

If it becomes clear that the warning given to a disruptive individual has been ignored or was not effective, the Executive Committee may choose to seek mediation from a neutral outside party.
The individual in question shall be notified in writing of the decision and may participate in the selection of the neutral party as well as in scheduling the meeting.
The individual must be given a chance to defend their actions.
Moving to mediation requires a unanimous vote of the Executive Committee and must be followed immediately by informing the Advisor of the pending mediation.
All Executive Committee members must be present at the meeting.

#### SUBSECTION C: REMOVAL

The Executive Committee may remove a member if and only if there is clear, presentable evidence or testimony from other members of the Organization that the individual in question has not corrected or otherwise properly addressed their disruptive behavior after both a warning and mediation.
At this point the Executive Committee may vote upon the removal of the individual from the Organization.
Removing a member requires the Executive Committee to vote unanimously in favor of the motion and written consent from the Advisor, who will be notified prior to the vote.
The individual must be notified in person of the Executive Committee&rsquo;s decision, with at least one neutral party present, and shall be provided a written transcript of the meeting following the proceedings.
Revocation of membership entails no longer being allowed to participate in or be present at activities of the Organization, vote, and no longer being able to represent the Organization either formally or informally.

Members&mdash;whether voting or non-voting&mdash;of the Board of Directors may be removed from office for cause as provided in the parliamentary authority.
