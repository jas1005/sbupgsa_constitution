### Section 1: General-Body Members

Should the Executive Committee be informed of a member acting in a disruptive manner while participating in an activity endorsed or organized by the organization or one of its affiliates, the Executive Committee reserves the right to take disciplinary action against the member.
Disciplinary action is a three-step process, enumerated in the following subsections.

#### SUBSECTION A: WARNINGS

The individual in question shall be notified formally by some verbal communication, which directly addresses the concerns of the Executive Committee and any related members.
Following the warning, said individual may be placed on a probationary period determined by the Executive Committee for no less than 1 month and no longer than 6 months.
The individual must be notified regarding their probationary status and be clearly informed as to the length of the period.
Should the disruptive behavior continue without regard for the warning, the Executive Committee may seek mediation, so long as the probationary period has not expired.
A member may be placed on probation a maximum of two times before proceeding to the mediation step.
Providing a warning to a member or placing a member on probation requires the support of a simple majority of the Executive Committee.
Once this course of action is decided, the Advisor shall be informed.
If any further infractions occur during the probationary period, then the Executive Committee will immediately move to mediation.
Probation can entail, but is not limited to: a simple, formal warning and review period, barring the member from participating in activities of the organization for a designated period of time, or revocation of the member&rsquo;s right to use shared spaces.

#### SUBSECTION B: MEDIATION

If it becomes clear that the warning given to a disruptive individual has been ignored or was not effective, the Executive Committee may choose to seek mediation from a neutral outside party.
The individual in question shall be notified in writing of the decision and may participate in the selection of the neutral party as well as in scheduling the meeting.
The individual must be given a chance to defend their actions.
Moving to mediation requires a unanimous vote of the Executive Committee and must be followed immediately by informing the Advisor of the pending mediation.
All Executive Committee members must be present at the meeting.

#### SUBSECTION C: REMOVAL

The Executive Committee may remove a member if and only if there is clear, presentable evidence or testimony from other members of the organization that the individual in question has not corrected or otherwise properly addressed their disruptive behavior after both a warning and mediation.
At this point the Executive Committee may vote upon the removal of the individual from the organization.
Removing a member requires the Executive Committee to vote unanimously in favor of the motion and written consent from the Advisor, who will be notified prior to the vote.
The individual must be notified in person of the Executive Committee&rsquo;s decision, with at least one neutral party present, and shall be provided a written transcript of the meeting following the proceedings.
Revocation of membership entails no longer being allowed to participate in or be present at activities of the organization, vote, and no longer being able to represent the organization either formally or informally.

### Section 2: Board Members

Members of the Board of Directors may be disciplined following the same procedure as that required for general body members with the additional step of first removing the member from the Board of Directors, which requires that the member in question be brought up on impeachment charges.

Any member of the Board of Directors may be issued a notice to attend a meeting of the Executive Committee for charges leading to impeachment by the President if they are accused of acting in a manner detrimental to the organization or are acting without regard for the responsibilities of their office.
Such a writ shall be issued should the President be provided a list of charges signed by three-quarters of the members of the Board of Directors.
If disciplinary action is to be taken against the President, such a list must be provided to the Vice President.
Upon receipt of the list, the member in question shall be suspended from their office and prevented from exercising all powers and voting rights until a meeting of the Executive Committee and the Advisor is convened, in which the member in question may defend themselves against the issued charges.
If the Executive Committee and Advisor unanimously find the individual in question guilty, the individual shall immediately be made destitute of all power and responsibilities within the organization and shall be made a general member.
If the Executive Committee and the Advisor cannot reach an unanimous decision, the charges shall be brought forth to the entire general membership body.
The member shall be removed successfully from the Board of Directors if three-quarters of the general membership body vote to do so.

## ARTICLE XI: SELECTION OF A NEW ADVISOR

The organization seeks to maintain close relations to the Department.
As such, the position of faculty Advisor shall remain with the chair of the Quality of Life Committee of the Department unless otherwise specified by the Executive Committee.
Should the chair at any point refuse the responsibility, an Advisor Search Committee chaired by the Vice President shall be formed within the organization, tasked with identifying and bringing to the attention of the Executive Committee candidates for a new advisor.
The Advisor Search Committee shall, given the approval of the Executive Committee, approach potential candidates for the position until a new advisor has been identified and instated.
This person shall serve until a chair of the Quality of Life Committee accepts the position, they choose to vacate otherwise, or the Executive Committee deems, with sufficient evidence, that this individual is no longer fit to serve.

## ARTICLE XII: DISBURSAL OF ASSETS IN THE EVENT THE GROUP BECOMES DEFUNCT

At the final meeting of the Board of Directors, all amendments receiving two-thirds support of the general body shall be discussed further and modified into their final forms.

When an amendment has been approved, it, as well as any text overwritten, shall be recorded in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-amendments-to-the-constitution) of this Constitution, in addition to its inclusion within the text of the Constitution.

## ARTICLE XIV: RATIFYING THE CONSTITUTION

A draft of the Constitution requires a simple majority (50% +1 vote) of a quorum of the general body in order to be ratified.
Should this threshold be met, the draft shall be recognized officially as the new Constitution of the organization.
This vote may be held electronically.

## ARTICLE XV: REVIEWING THE CONSTITUTION

The Constitution shall be reviewed and updated annually at the final meeting of the Board of Directors of the academic year.
